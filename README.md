# Victory Native

This package imports components from `victory-core-native`, `victory-pie-native`, and `victory-chart-native`

# Usage
With npm, run:
```sh
$ npm install victory-native --save
```
Link react-native-svg with:
```sh
$ react-native link react-native-svg
```

Import charts from `victory-native`. E.g.,
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { VictoryBar } from "victory-native";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <VictoryBar />
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

### Running demo
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then open `demo/ios/Demo.xcodeproj` and run the app. (Note: `npm start` must run _before_ you run the app).

## _IMPORTANT_

This project is in a pre-release state. We're hard at work fixing bugs and improving the API. Be prepared for breaking changes!
